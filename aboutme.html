    <h2>B.S. Biomedical Engineering 
    <br>University of Rochester   </h2>

    

       <p><br>During my undergrad, I participated in a physics REU (on an interdisciplinary project with the mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, 
	       physics, &amp; computer science departments) where I designed &amp; executed experiments to validate existing and predicted models with the goal of 
	       understanding the robotic physics of non-biologically inspired locomotion strategies in complex media. Through this project I learned various hardware and software for simulation, 
	       computational modleing, &amp; development: including arduino for programming a circuit board and abaqus for finite element analysis. I ran efficient simulations &amp; 
	       picked up modeling skills to analyze real-world systems.<br> <br></p> 

       <p><br> <br>I also worked for the simulation lab at the University Hospital where I designed and engineered patient specific and general models used for 
	       surgical practice for the Da Vinci Surgical System (a robotic assisted surgical system). I performed mechanical testing, 3D printing, 
	       Solidworks (computer aided design), CT analysis, and studied relavant surgical techniques that would be used on these models.</p> 

       <p><br><br>(And if you thought that wasn't keeping me occupied) During the last two years of my undergrad, I worked in a research lab at the Center for 
	       Translational Neuromedicine on research for the development of novel approaches in curing neurological diseases and the study of neurogenesis in adults. </p>
  
  	  <p><br>Additionally, I have a strong background and passion for saxophone performance. </p>

      <p>During my first year of undergrad, I studied classical saxophone with Nicki Roman. Soon after, I began my studies in jazz saxophone with 
	      Doug Stone with whom I have now studied privately with for over 4 years. I have also gained experience through a variety of performing opportunities. 
	      I was lead alto saxophone in the Eastman Jazz Workshop Ensemble at the 
	      Eastman School &amp; lead alto in the river campus jazz ensemble. I also performed in smaller jazz combos.</p>
