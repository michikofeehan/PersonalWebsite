    <h3>Biomedical engineering<br/> 

    <p>University of Rochester</p></h2>

    

       <p>During my undergrad, I participated in a physics REU (on an interdisciplinary project with the mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, physics, &amp; computer science departments) where I designed &amp; executed experiments to validate existing and predicted models with the goal of understanding the robotic physics of non-biologically inspired locomotion strategies in complex media. Through this project I learned various hardware and software for simulation, modleing, &amp; development: including arduino for programming a circuit board and abaqus for finite element analysis. I ran efficient simulations &amp; picked up modeling skills to analyze real-world systems.</p> 

       <p>I also worked for the simulation lab at the University Hospital where I designed and engineered patient specific and general models used for surgeical practice for the Da Vinci Surgical System (a robotic assisted surgical system). I performed mechanical testing, 3D printing, Solidworks (computer aided design), CT analysis, and studied relavant surgical techniques that would be used on these models.</p> 

       <p>(And if you thought that wasn't keeping me occupied) During the last two years of my undergrad, I worked in a research lab at the Center for Translational Neuromedicine on research for the development of novel approaches in curing neurological diseases and the study of neurogenesis in adults. </p>
  
  	  <p>Let's switch gears for a bit;</p>

      <p> During my first year of undergrad, I studied classical saxophone with Nicki Roman. Soon after, I began my studies in jazz saxophone with Doug Stone with whom I have now studied privately with for over 4 years.</p> 

       <p>During my undergrad I was lucky to have had a variety of performing opportunities. I was lead alto saxophone in the Eastman Jazz Workshop Ensemble at the Eastman School &amp; lead alto in the river campus jazz ensemble. I also performed in smaller jazz combos.</p>
